# Requirements
## Introduction
- Motor parameter calculation is a program which can be used by peole to calculate the current, speed and torque at diffrent load conditions by feeding the parameters of DC and AC motors. 

## Research
At present we have softwares like simulink, MATLAB etc softwares to simulate motors and give accurate results. To access this software we need to buy the license. These softwares can perform complex calculations but it takes time to provide output. Since this is a large software lower version of computers can take lot of time to process output. 

## Features and Benefits of project
This project will provide basic calclulation of motor parameter in less time. It can be helpful for students while dealing with the numerical problems related to motors and general public to calculate basic pameters to decide which motor to choose.

## Benefits
- Fast processing
- A user friendly envirounment.
- Increases efficiency of program.
- Cost effective.

## Cost and Features
![Description](Link to Pic) As long as requirements are met the cost of project could be varied as per requirement.

- Motor parameter calculator aims on providing user with options: . 
    - calculate Speed, Torque and current.
    - Reduce calculation time.
    - Provide variety of motor
    

## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT-Analysis]()

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
- Students and general public who wants to select appropriate motor for thier application.

## What:
- Normally students calculate all the parameters manually which is time consuming. This project will resolve this issue.

## When:
- It can be used at any point of time since this is a basic reqirement. As all the systems are getting digitized this aspect can also be taken into consideration.

## Where:
- This project can be used in schools, colleges, etc for mathematical calculations related to electric motors.

## How:
- The project askes the user to enter the basic details about the motor which then is applied in speed, torque and parameters equations to obtain the results.
